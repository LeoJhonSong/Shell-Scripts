# Shell-Scripts
My collection of powerful homemade scripts ðŸ˜ƒ

## Requirements

as the name shows, these scripts are only for shell in **Linux**, only tested on **Ubuntu18.04**

## Installation

### for common users

```shell
git clone https://github.com/LeoJhonSong/Shell-Scripts.git
```

then if you use **bash** as shell, run this

```shell
echo -e "\n# shell-script path\nexport PATH=$(pwd)/Shell-Scripts/:\$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc
```

if you use **zsh** as shell, run this

```shell
echo -e "\n# shell-script path\nexport PATH=$(pwd)/Shell-Scripts/:\$PATH" >> ~/.zshrc
```

### for myself

```shell
git clone git@github.com:LeoJhonSong/Shell-Scripts.git
echo -e "\n# shell-script path\nexport PATH=$(pwd)/Shell-Scripts/:\$PATH" >> ~/.zshrc
```
